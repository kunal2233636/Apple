# Algebra Basics

## Introduction

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. It's the foundation for advanced mathematics and many real-world applications.

## Key Concepts

### Variables

A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value.

**Examples:**
- `x`, `y`, `z` are common variables
- In `x + 5 = 10`, `x` is the variable we need to find

### Constants

A constant is a fixed value that doesn't change.

**Examples:**
- Numbers like 5, -3, 0.5
- Mathematical constants like π (pi) or e

### Expressions

An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operations.

**Examples:**
- `3x + 7`
- `2y - 5x + 10`
- `x² + 4x - 3`

### Equations

An equation states that two expressions are equal, connected by an equals sign (=).

**Examples:**
- `x + 5 = 10`
- `2y - 3 = 7`
- `3x + 2 = 5x - 4`

## Solving Linear Equations

### One-Step Equations

**Example:** Solve `x + 5 = 10`

**Solution:**
1. Subtract 5 from both sides: `x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5`
2. Simplify: `x = 5`

### Two-Step Equations

**Example:** Solve `2x + 3 = 11`

**Solution:**
1. Subtract 3 from both sides: `2x = 8`
2. Divide both sides by 2: `x = 4`

### Multi-Step Equations

**Example:** Solve `3x + 7 = 2x + 12`

**Solution:**
1. Subtract 2x from both sides: `x + 7 = 12`
2. Subtract 7 from both sides: `x = 5`

## The Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

When simplifying expressions, follow this order:
1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

**Example:** Simplify `3 + 2 × 4`
- First multiply: `2 × 4 = 8`
- Then add: `3 + 8 = 11`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not performing the same operation on both sides**
   - Wrong: `x + 5 = 10` → `x = 10` (forgot to subtract 5)
   - Right: `x + 5 = 10` → `x = 5`

2. **Incorrect order of operations**
   - Wrong: `3 + 2 × 4 = 5 × 4 = 20`
   - Right: `3 + 2 × 4 = 3 + 8 = 11`

3. **Sign errors when distributing negatives**
   - Wrong: `-(x + 3) = -x + 3`
   - Right: `-(x + 3) = -x - 3`

## Practice Problems

1. Solve: `x - 7 = 15`
2. Solve: `4x = 20`
3. Solve: `3x + 5 = 20`
4. Solve: `5x - 3 = 2x + 9`
5. Simplify: `2(x + 3) + 4x`

## Answers

1. `x = 22`
2. `x = 5`
3. `x = 5`
4. `x = 4`
5. `6x + 6`
