# Fundamental Laws of Physics

## Introduction

Physics is governed by fundamental laws that describe how the universe works. Understanding these laws is essential for studying motion, energy, and forces.

## Newton's Three Laws of Motion

### First Law: Law of Inertia

**Statement:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

**Key Concept:** Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their state of motion.

**Examples:**
- A book on a table stays at rest until someone pushes it
- A hockey puck sliding on ice continues moving until friction stops it
- Passengers lurch forward when a car suddenly brakes

### Second Law: Force and Acceleration

**Statement:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Formula:** `F = ma`
- F = Force (Newtons)
- m = mass (kilograms)
- a = acceleration (meters per second squared)

**Examples:**
- Pushing a shopping cart: more force = more acceleration
- A heavier cart requires more force to achieve the same acceleration
- A 10 kg object with 20 N force: `a = F/m = 20/10 = 2 m/s²`

### Third Law: Action-Reaction

**Statement:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Key Concept:** Forces always come in pairs. When object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

**Examples:**
- Jumping: you push down on the ground, the ground pushes you up
- Rocket propulsion: exhaust gases push backward, rocket moves forward
- Swimming: you push water backward, water pushes you forward

## Law of Universal Gravitation

**Statement:** Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

**Formula:** `F = G(m₁m₂)/r²`
- F = gravitational force
- G = gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²)
- m₁, m₂ = masses of the two objects
- r = distance between centers of the objects

**Applications:**
- Planetary orbits
- Tides (moon's gravitational pull on Earth)
- Satellite motion

## Conservation Laws

### Conservation of Energy

**Statement:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**Forms of Energy:**
- Kinetic energy: energy of motion (`KE = ½mv²`)
- Potential energy: stored energy (`PE = mgh` for gravitational)
- Thermal energy: heat
- Chemical energy: stored in bonds
- Electrical energy: from moving charges

**Example:** A pendulum converts potential energy to kinetic energy and back:
- At the top: maximum PE, zero KE
- At the bottom: zero PE, maximum KE
- Total energy remains constant (ignoring friction)

### Conservation of Momentum

**Statement:** In a closed system, the total momentum before an event equals the total momentum after the event.

**Formula:** `p = mv` (momentum = mass × velocity)

**Example:** Two ice skaters pushing off each other:
- Before: both at rest, total momentum = 0
- After: they move in opposite directions, but total momentum still = 0
- If skater A (50 kg) moves at 2 m/s right, skater B (60 kg) moves at 1.67 m/s left

## Laws of Thermodynamics

### First Law (Conservation of Energy)

**Statement:** The change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system.

**Formula:** `ΔU = Q - W`

### Second Law (Entropy)

**Statement:** The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. Heat naturally flows from hot to cold, not the reverse.

**Key Concept:** You can't have a perfectly efficient heat engine.

### Third Law

**Statement:** As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum.

## Practical Applications

### Engineering
- Bridge design uses Newton's laws to calculate forces
- Rocket science applies conservation of momentum
- Power plants use thermodynamics principles

### Everyday Life
- Seatbelts protect using Newton's first law (inertia)
- Refrigerators work based on thermodynamics
- Sports equipment design considers energy conservation

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Heavier objects fall faster"**
   - False: In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate
   - Air resistance affects lighter objects more

2. **"Force is needed to keep objects moving"**
   - False: Newton's first law says objects continue moving without force
   - Force is only needed to overcome friction

3. **"Action-reaction forces cancel out"**
   - False: They act on different objects, so they don't cancel

## Problem-Solving Tips

1. **Draw a diagram** showing all forces
2. **Identify the system** you're analyzing
3. **List known and unknown values**
4. **Choose the right equation** for the situation
5. **Check units** to ensure consistency
6. **Verify your answer** makes physical sense

## Practice Problems

1. A 5 kg object accelerates at 3 m/s². What force is applied?
2. If you push a wall with 100 N of force, how much force does the wall push back?
3. A 2 kg ball moving at 5 m/s collides with a stationary 3 kg ball. If they stick together, what's their final velocity?

## Answers

1. F = ma = 5 kg × 3 m/s² = 15 N
2. 100 N (Newton's third law)
3. Using conservation of momentum: (2×5 + 3×0)/(2+3) = 2 m/s
